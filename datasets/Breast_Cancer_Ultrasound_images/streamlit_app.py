    ### About the Technology
    This app uses a **Deep Learning model** built with **DenseNet121** architecture for image classification.
    The model was trained on a large dataset of breast ultrasound images to predict if a given image is benign, malignant, or normal.

    ##### Disclaimer:
    The app serves as a **support tool** for initial detection and should not be relied upon as a diagnostic tool. Always consult a healthcare professional for further assessment.
